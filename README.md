# NYC Airbnb and Housing Prices

This project was created for my Gov1005 final project at Harvard University.

The project displays data on housing and airbnb prices for different neighborhoods throughout the city. I also run a statistical analysis in an attempt to explain airbnb prices by housing prices within a neighborhood.

The data from this website comes from Zillow's "Zillow Research" Platform and InsiderAirbnb, a website that provides airbnb data on cities across the world.
